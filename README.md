# AeroDesign-Performance

Performance study of a small aircraft, builded to compete in the SAE Brasil AeroDesign 2018.

The whole aircraft design process was aided by python and fortran scripts, and validate on real flights.

The **performance.py** script aim to test the performance of a concptual aircraft design. For this task the algorithm propused by *Roskam* was used to calculate the theorical drag coefficient(Cd), and plot a *V-N Diagram*.
