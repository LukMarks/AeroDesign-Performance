# AeroDesign-Performance

Performance study of a small aircraft, builded to compete in the SAE Brasil AeroDesign 2018.

The whole aircraft design process was aided by python and fortran scripts, and validate on real flights.

The **performance.py** script aim to test the performance of a concptual aircraft design. For this task the algorithm propused by *Roskam* was used to calculate the theorical drag coefficient(Cd), and plot a *V-N Diagram*.

### Long Story Short 

The script generate the curve a O.S 55 engine measured in wind tunnel and compare with the *Roskam algorithm* results, as the **Figure 01** shows, it's possbile to find out the maximum and de minimum flight speed. The **Figure 02** ilustrate the resulting *V-N Diagram*. The final results are showed next the **Figure 02**.
